Objects
-------

Kubernetes Objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Specifically, they can describe:

1. What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)
2. The resources available to those applications
3. The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance

The kubernetes object is made of one or more kubernetes resources(node,Container.Pod,Replication controller,replicaset,deployment,service)

The object is define by a yaml or json file.The object definition consists of two parts
1. genearal info about the object (api version, kind ,metadta(name, uuid, label))
2. The object spec that defines the desired state of the object

The kubernetes system sees the object spec and compares the current status with the desired state and always work to keep the current state same as the desired state.
